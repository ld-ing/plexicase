# Plexicase Selection in Symbolic Regression

We currently provide a generic implementation of $\epsilon$-plexicase selection (see ep-plexicase.py), which can be easily used with existing GP and SR libraries. 

The full implementation of experiments on the SRBench dataset will be released soon. Please stay tuned.
